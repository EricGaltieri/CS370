    Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
    Modified a python code on Jupyter Notbook to create an AI to solve the reasure hunt maze game. 
    
    Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
        What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
        They design and create software and hardware use to solve problems.
        
        
        How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
        I break down ideas into small chunks that can be tied into larger systems that already exist or that im creating to solve a problem. 
        
        What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
        We must ensure that software is used correctly and that information that we use to create systems like AI are done ethicly and with a high moral judgement.
